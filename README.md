# 🦁 Zoo Animal Interaction Simulation

## 📜 Description
This Java project simulates animal interactions in a zoo environment, including **movement**, **hunting**, and **reproduction** behaviors. Designed with **SOLID principles** in mind, the simulation demonstrates good object-oriented practices and a modular code structure.

The project features different animal species:
- 🐑 **Sheep**
- 🐄 **Cow**
- 🐺 **Wolf**
- 🦁 **Lion**

Each species has unique behaviors and characteristics within the zoo.

## 🧠 Features
✅ Animal movement across a 2D grid  
✅ Distance calculation between animals  
✅ Predator-prey interactions (hunting)  
✅ Reproduction logic based on gender and distance  
✅ Species-specific behavior  
✅ Modular and extendable architecture following SOLID principles  

---

## 🛠 Principles Applied
